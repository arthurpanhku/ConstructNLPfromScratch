# ConstructNLPfromScratch

## Introduction
ConstructNLPfromScratch is a project aimed at building a Natural Language Processing (NLP) system from the ground up. This repository provides a step-by-step implementation to help learners and developers understand the core concepts of NLP, including tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, and basic language modeling, without relying on high-level libraries.
This project is altered based on Minimind Project:  https://github.com/jingyaogong/minimind 

## Features
- Custom tokenization and sentence splitting
- Basic part-of-speech tagging implementation
- Simple language model using n-grams
- Extensible framework for adding new NLP components
